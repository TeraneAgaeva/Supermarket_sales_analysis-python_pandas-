The growth of supermarkets in the most populated cities is increasing, and the competition in the market is also high. The dataset is an unloading of historical sales of a supermarket chain company in 3 different branches for 3 months.

Goal: This dataset can be used for the purpose of understanding sales trends, which products in which city should be sold, and which should be reduced in supply. Based on the data, it is possible to estimate future sales trends, evaluate consumer behavior and optimize the sales strategy.

We will implement elements of analysis in this direction using the pandas libraries in Python.
